I organized and put together a club whereby lab member would get together virtually (during COVID-19 pandemic time)
to learn how to code and analyze data.

Since MATLAB is a pay-to-play gig, and since our lab specifically uses MATLAB, I decided to start some sessions by 
demonstrating how we extract, convert, and analyze neural data. This part of the process allows users some second-hand
MATLAB experience, and to see a general workflow unfold in front of them. This is an important concept because learning
how to code is also learning how to set up and visualize what you want to do.

Then, because of the pay-to-play set-up of MATLAB, we took the code to free languages; specifically R and Python. I 
chose these languages as they have great libraries to analyze what we want to do. But also because they were two languages
that I had some experience with, but could get much better at.

So this club serves multiple purposes:
1) teach people how to code
2) teach people how to organize/analyze data in a script/function
3) learn more than one language
